                  <p className='para3'>iMerit’s expert team can transcribe audio to text, and then perform nuanced annotations upon the text datasets, providing highly-accurate transcriptions with a rapid turnaround time. iMerit offers customers best-in-class pricing for any project type across file formats including WAV, MP3, FLAC, and more.

Customers can share audio data securely with iMerit by uploading audio files directly into the platform or through a designated digital dropbox.</p>
