                      <p className='para10Text'>CrowdReason has huge volumes of taxation data from its client base. These data vary across geographies, and tax jurisdictions, that need to be processed and structured quickly and accurately. iMerit’s experts have developed a workflow to break down the data extraction process into smaller tasks. These tasks are tackled by iMerit’s trained text annotation teams.</p>
                      <p className='para11Text'>“iMerit was and continues to be, an invaluable partner for us. They provided us with accurate data early on, which helped us get up and running with the development of our tax property software.”<span> — Brandon Van Volkenburgh, CTO & Co-founder, CrowdReason</span></p>

                      <p className='para12Text'>iMerit’s customer provides a service that helps subscribers improve the quality of their writing by correcting mistakes and providing word and phrase suggestions. The company needed multiple wording suggestions to confirm and refine a sentence correction algorithm. The challenge was in balancing the subjective and nuanced nature of copy-editing with the need for a rule-based style standardization. Our text annotation teams were trained rigorously in the customer’s style guide. Continuous assessment and peer learning, along with close collaboration with the customer in areas of ambiguity enables the team to deliver high-quality stylistic, structural, and mechanical corrections on a variety of document sources.</p>
